# AI-Generated (GitHub Copilot)  
def sort_list_of_dicts(list_of_dicts, key):
    return sorted(list_of_dicts, key=lambda x: x[key])

# Manual Implementation  
def manual_sort_dicts(data, sort_key):
    return sorted(data, key=lambda item: item.get(sort_key))

200-Word Analysis
The AI-generated function efficiently sorts a list of dictionaries using Python’s built-in sorted() with a lambda function. However, it assumes the key always exists, risking a KeyError if absent. The manual implementation improves robustness by using .get() instead of direct key access, handling missing keys gracefully.

Both functions have O(n log n) time complexity since they rely on Python’s Timsort algorithm. However, the manual version is preferable in real-world applications where data integrity is uncertain.

Why Manual Version is Better?

Error Handling: .get() avoids crashes if a key is missing.

Readability: Explicitly naming variables (item, sort_key) improves clarity.

Maintainability: Easier to modify (e.g., adding default values for missing keys).

Conclusion: While AI tools accelerate coding, manual review ensures reliability, especially in edge cases. For production use, the manual implementation is superior.
